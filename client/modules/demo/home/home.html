<div class="home-text">
    <p>Welcome to the Angular 1.5 template.</p>
    <p>This is the demo module, which will help you get started on the template. It provides several examples of how to use the template.</p>
    <p>While it is ugly now, we are working with a proper UI designer to clean up the look and feel and make it responsive.</p>
    <p>Once you are up-to-speed with the template and ready to start on your own modules, you can delete the demo module by deleting the demo folder.</p>
